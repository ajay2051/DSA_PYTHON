# Big O Notation O(n)

Big O Notation is used to measure how running time or space requirements for your program grow as 
input size grows.

time = a*n + b where b is constant
(1) Keep the fastest growing terms
    time = a * n
(2) Drop Constants
    time = O(n)

Big O refers to very large number of n.
    time = 5 * nÂ² + 3 * n + 20
when value of n is very large 3 * n + 20 becomes irrelevant.

Measuring running time growth: time complexity
Measuring space growth: space complexity

Binary Search Iteration k = n/2^k
